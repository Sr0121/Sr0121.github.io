**题目描述**

Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
```

**Note:**

- The linked list will have at least two elements.
- All of the nodes' values will be unique.
- The given node will not be the tail and it will always be a valid node of the linked list.
- Do not return anything from your function.

题目描述有点问题，题目的原意是给一个node，直接在该node存在的list中删除这个node，因为不知道父节点的地址，所以只需要将node的val改成node.next的val，然后把node.next设置成node.next.next就可以了。

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def deleteNode(self, node):
        """
        :type node: ListNode
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify node in-place instead.
        """
        node.val = node.next.val
        node.next = node.next.next
```
